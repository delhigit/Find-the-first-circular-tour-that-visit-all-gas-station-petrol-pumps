If car starts at A and can not reach B. Any station between A and B
can not reach B.(B is the first station that A can not reach.)
If the total number of gas is bigger than the total number of cost. There must be a solution.


int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost)
    {
        int startPoint = 0;
        int petrolDeficit = 0;
        int totalTankPetrol = 0;
        
        int totalStation = gas.size();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < totalStation; i++)
        {
           totalTankPetrol = totalTankPetrol + gas[i] - cost[i]; 
            
            if(totalTankPetrol < 0)
            {
                startPoint = i + 1;
                petrolDeficit = petrolDeficit + totalTankPetrol;
                totalTankPetrol = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return (totalTankPetrol + petrolDeficit >= 0)? startPoint : -1;
    }
